# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Our goal here was to go through the data and help an Uber-esque type company figure out the numbers by city type, and a few other distinct categories. After that, we graph the data for easy reading. That way we can make some decisions and judgements off of our findings.
## Results

Our first two graphs show you immediately that the bulk of our rides come from urban areas. Suburban areas come in second place. Lastly, the rural areas show up. That is interesting and of course we want to see what we can find based on that. More analysis was needed.

With a few more graphs we can come up with a few more conclusions. The bulk of our riders and fare does in fact come from the urban areas. When you look at the percentage of total fare, you will notice that the gap bewteen the three city types get a little smaller. We see that per ride, we make more off of the suburban and rural area. We see that the urban area also is sitting pretty heavy on drivers. While the rural and suburban areas are a little low based on their percentage of fares contributed.
## Recommendations
1. I would suggest the company finds a way to get some of the urban drivers to venture out and do some rural and suburban areas. The fare per rides there are worth it.
2. I would suggest the company focus on the suburban area to maximize profits. Seeing as it has 16% of the total drivers driving suburban customers, yet the suburban area accounts for 30%+ of total fares. If the suburban area ever saw as many riders as the urban area, your profits would skyrocket.
3. The end of April, the suburban areas get pretty close to making just as much as the urban city type areas. That may be the best time to test out increasing sales.
